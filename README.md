## Development

```bash
# install dependencies
$ pnpm i

# serve with hot reload at localhost:5173
$ pnpm dev

# build for production and launch server
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm start
```

## Voices

Currently only using Google Cloud Text to Speech voice _en-US-Studio-Q_.
All audio is transfered to 320kb/s mp3 in Apple Music.

## Maps

Currently using Figma but it's quite slow to edit.

## To improve

- [ ] Add multiple voices
- [ ] Fix errors in texts and spoken text
- [ ] Add maps to all chapters
- [ ] Better looking maps
- [ ] Use 2nd edition booklet. I own only first edition.
